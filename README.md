# **Lev** is a true multisite CMS

	* `Lev` makes strict separation between host (engine) and site, namely:
		- host and site is absolutally different entities, host manages site or is a service for a site.
		- one host may serve many sites.
		- CMS and host is the same, or host is CMS implementation.
		- site is a page's configurator according to some host rules.
		- supports Lev sites anywhere on disk, not in an `user/env` dir only
		- and so on...
